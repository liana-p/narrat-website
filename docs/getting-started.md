# README

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed \(Made using `15.5.0`, LTS probably also works, not tested\). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to simplify node installation \(not on Windows\).

Narrat is a JavaScript library you can add to a web project.

One simple way to set it up is to use the [Narrat Template App](https://github.com/nialna/narrat-template).

Otherwise, use your preferred way of setting up a JS web project, and add `narrat` as a library

## Install on a project

`npm install narrat`

For narrat to run, it needs two pieces of data:

* The `config` file which contains the path of your script files and other info
* The `characters` file which contains the list of characters in the game

Copy the example `characters.json` and `config.json` from the `public/data` folders somewhere in your app, and have an `#app` div in your page's html including your javascript \(you can copy `public/index.html`\) .

Then in your javascript code to launch narrat, use:

```text
import { startApp } from 'narrat';
// Call `startApp` to run the game, passing the path to your config file and characters file.
startApp({
  charactersPath: 'data/characters.json', // Replace with whatever path you have
  configPath: 'data/config.json',
});
```

## Customising your game

#### config.json

The config file contains basic info about your game. In it you can add new skills and change their name.

This is also where the scripts used in your game are listed. By default it only uses `data/example.rpy` but you can add more scripts to the list and they will all get loaded.

#### characters.json

The `characters.json` file contains the config for all characters that can speak in the game. They should all at least have a name value.

You can change the color their name appears as by changing the `color` value in the `style` property of the character \(you can use any CSS valid color\).

If you want to customise even more, you can put a CSS properties object in the following properties:

* `stylesboxCss`: Will apply CSS to the container of a dialogue line for this character
* `style.nameCss`: Will apply CSS to the text with the title of the character
* `style.textCss`: Will apply CSS to the actual dialogue text for the character.

Example:

```text
    "player": {
      "style": {
        "color": "orange",
        "textCss": {
            "color": "blue"
        },
        "boxCss": {
            "backgroundColor": "white"
        }
      },
      "name": "You"
    },
```

## Writing code

Narrat script is split into labels, which are the first level of indentation you see in the code \(labels `main:` and `testLabel:` in the example below\). Those labels are standalone pieces of script which can be played at anytime. `main` is the label that gets launched when the game starts.

The syntax is based on indentation: An indent level is 4 spaces, and entering a new indentation level means entering a new block in the code.

This syntax is largely inspired by renpy syntax.

Note: The parser for the code is very new and likely to break if pushed too much.

### Adding your scripts to your game

To add new scripts to your game, add their path to the list in your `config.json` file. Make sure one of your files has a `main` label, as that's where the game will start.

Look at the example code to see syntax.

```text
main:
    "You open the narrat demo and wonder how this thing even works"
    choice:
        "How about asking for help?"
        "Ask for help":
            jump askForHelp
        "No, I don't want help ðŸ˜¡"
            jump dontAskForHelp

    wait 2000
    play sound "alarm"
    wait 2000
    play sound "alarm"
    clear_dialog
    talk helper idle "Hello! I heard you're trying to play the narrat demo!"
    talk helper idle "As you've probably noticed, you can make choices in this."
    talk helper idle "There are lots of things you can do to make an interactive story in Narrat really. Choices are one of the most useful ones."
    talk helper idle "I'm going to send you to my other friend who has some questions for you."
    jump askAboutChoices

askAboutChoices:
    choice:
        talk cat idle "Hi it's me, another generic cat! Do you like making choices in games?"
        "Yes":
            set likeChoices true
            "Cat will remember this."
        "No":
            set likeChoices false
            "Cat will remember this."
    choice:
        talk helper idle "Now I think we should do an activity, what do you like doing?"
        "let's make choices cause I like making choices!" $if this.data.likeChoices: // A choice can have a condition so it only appears in the list if the condition is met
            jump makeChoices
        "let's do nothing!":
            jump doNothing

    jump main

        talk inner idle "I don't know, we've been making a lot of choices already lately."
        "I still want to make a choice!":
            talk helper idle "Well you just made one, it turns out. Can we continue now?"
            jump doNothing
        "I guess you're right":
            jump doNothing


doNothing:
    choice:
        talk music_cat idle "How about we get some music in here?"
        "Yeah! Play some epic music":
            play music metal
        "Play some relaxing music":
            play music calm
        "I hate music":
            talk music_cat idle "Well too bad, it's up to you."
    jump otherFeatures

otherFeatures:
    talk helper idle "There are lots of other features, like skill checks and conditions."
    $if this.skillCheck("someSkillCheck", "testSkill", 40): // You can use skillchecks in conditions
        "For example this line only appears if you passed a skill check"
    "This engine is still very early and not fully documented yet, but you can use at the example demo and how it is made."
    "There is also a screen feature on the left where you can display background images with interactive buttons."
    jump showMap

showMap:
    set_screen map
    set_button parkButton true
    talk helper idle "This is an example map. There are buttons you can click on. It is possible to dynanically enable and disable buttons in your script"

shopButton:
    "You visit the shop and buy some water and a snack"
    talk inner idle "That water was very hydrating!"
    talk helper idle "Now that you're well hydrated and on your way to eat your 5 a day, you could learn more about how to make games"
    talk helper idle "The best way is to read the readme page on the narrat github page"
    talk helper idle "You can look at how the demo is made, especially by opening the example.rpy file which is the script for this demo"

parkButton:
    "You go on a walk to the little park"
    talk inner idle "That was a nice walk! Now I feel like going to the shop to buy water"
    set_button shopButton true
