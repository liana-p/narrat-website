# Save Commands

There are two commands for manual saving:

### save

Syntax: `save [save_name]`: Saves the game, with optionally save\_name being the name to use for the file. If no save name provided, the engine will generate a default one

### save\_prompt

Same as save, but will ask the player if they want to save first, and cancel if they choose no
