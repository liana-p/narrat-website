# Getting Started

## Getting Started

{% hint style="info" %}
Getting started with narrat is very quick. There is a ready-to-use template that can get you running your game in a minute
{% endhint %}

### Prerequisites

* Have [node.js ](https://nodejs.org/en/)installed (LTS version is fine)
* Have a text editor ready to go. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Know how to [open a terminal in a folder](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/)

### Creating the game

Use the [Narrat Template App](https://github.com/nialna/narrat-template). Users of git can press the "Use this template" button to generate a repo based on it. Otherwise, simply download it as a zip somewhere

{% hint style="info" %}
If not using git, simply download the template as a zip fileby pressing the code button next to the green "Use this template" button
{% endhint %}

For more advanced manual installation instruction into an existing web project, see the [Installing Narrat in a web app](installing-narrat-in-a-web-app.md) guide

## Running the game

With the narrat template cloned or downloaded, [open a terminal inside the folder](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/)

There is a first command to install the dependencies (libraries) on first use.

```bash
npm install
```

Once everything is installed, this command runs the game:

```bash
npm start
```

This should open a browser tab with the game running after a minute. The game can be accessed at https://localhost:8080

The game is ready to edit!

{% hint style="info" %}
Those `npm` commands come from node.js. If the commands aren't recognised, you probably didn't install node.js correctly. [More about npm install](https://www.stackchief.com/tutorials/npm%20install%20|%20how%20it%20works)
