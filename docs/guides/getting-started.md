# Getting Started

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (This was made using `15.5.0`, LTS probably also works, not tested).

One simple way to set it up is to use the [Narrat Template App](https://github.com/nialna/narrat-template). You can press the "Use this template" button to create your own repo based on it. If you don't want to use GitHub, you can just download it as a zip file and start editing it to make your game.

If you'd rather use your own preferred way of setting up a JS web project, and add `narrat` as a library, follow this guide:

{% endcontent-ref %}

## Running the game

Now that you have a local folder with a copy of the template ready, [open a terminal there](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/)

Install all the dependencies and tools:

```bash
npm install
```

Once everything is installed, you can start the game:

```bash
npm start
```

This should open a browser tab with the game running. Otherwise you can access it at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
