# Getting Help

### Discord server

The [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Xgz7EQ2Xgh) is a good place to get help, as the main developer is on it to answer questions or make bugfixes. Other users can also help with common issues

### GitHub issues

It is also possible to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/liana-p/narrat/issues) to report a bug or suggest a feature
